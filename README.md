# Hour Challenges!
The main point of an hour challenge is to push myself to learn new technologies by having a time limit to completion of a certain task.
This task is generated with the help of ChatGPT, and as a push from my end I don't use chatGPT for any debugging task. However, I have access to
the net!
# The 2 hour Weather Dashboard Challenge!
More details are presented in the Challenge text file. 
# The experience:
It was a pretty challenging experience to fit all the features in 2 hours for a webapp. There were several functionalities I'd have liked to include 
within this space but didn't have the time, and I realized that I needed more practice. I had to use templates for some of the front end parts due to a lack of practice.
# Remaining Features:
- Adding a search recommender: The API included a method to retrieve search recommendations for an incomplete query. Integrating this would have taken
  time and was skipped.
- Better UI: The 2 hour rushed UI is very unpolished and requires a major overhaul. Especially for the output page.
- Themes: Custom themes for each page would be nice to look at but are difficult to implement honestly.
# Takeaways:
- 2 hours is a decent amount of time to pull together somewhat of a working demo or a proof of concept. (Highly unpolished tho)
- The major consumer of time was integrating templates with the flask app, this caused a lot of issues that had to be solved without much progress.
- There's a constant need to revise some concepts that are perceived as "EH! I know that concept well!"
