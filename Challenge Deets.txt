Challenge: Real-Time Weather Dashboard in Two hours

Description:
Create a real-time weather dashboard that fetches weather information for a user-specified location and displays it in a user-friendly format. The application should allow users to input the city or coordinates (latitude and longitude), and it should fetch and display real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather condition.

Requirements:

Use a programming language of your choice.
Utilize a weather API to fetch real-time data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack).
Display the fetched weather information in a clear and visually appealing way.
Handle potential errors, such as invalid input or API request failures.
Implement a user-friendly interface for input and output.
